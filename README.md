# Evermark Beta

> Decentralized content preservation with unified storage architecture - Built for permanence, optimized for performance.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with Netlify Functions
npx netlify dev

# Start Vite only (limited functionality)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Evermark Beta follows a **feature-first architecture** for maximum maintainability:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Pure business logic, types, utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/       # Self-contained feature modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/      # React Context providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/           # External service integrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/         # Route components
```

### Core Principles

- **Unified Storage**: Content preserved on ArDrive (Arweave) for permanence, IPFS for speed
- **Feature Isolation**: Each feature is independently testable and maintainable
- **Pure Functions**: All business logic as testable pure functions
- **Single State Hook**: One hook per feature for centralized state management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Clean Separation**: UI components contain no business logic
- **SDK-Powered**: Core functionality provided by the evermark-sdk
- **Season Management**: Automated weekly seasons with smart contract coordination

## üèÜ Points System

Evermark rewards community participation with a comprehensive points system designed to encourage quality content creation and marketplace activity.

### How to Earn Points

| Action | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Create Evermark** | 10 points | Mint a new Evermark NFT with quality content |
| **Vote on Content** | 1 point | Delegate voting power to help curate quality |
| **Stake $EMARK** | 1 point/1M tokens | Lock tokens to gain voting power (minimum 1M $EMARK) |
| **Buy NFT** | 1 point | Purchase an Evermark from the marketplace |
| **List NFT for Sale** | 1 point | Create a marketplace listing for your Evermark |

### Marketplace Integration

The marketplace system is fully integrated with the points reward structure:

- **Buying**: Every successful NFT purchase earns 1 point automatically
- **Selling**: Creating a marketplace listing earns 1 point when the listing is created
- **Real-time Updates**: Points are awarded immediately upon transaction confirmation
- **Cross-platform**: Works in both browser and Farcaster miniapp environments

### Points Strategy

**Content Creators**: Focus on creating high-quality Evermarks (10 points each) and engaging with the community through voting (1 point each).

**Collectors**: Participate in the marketplace by buying quality Evermarks (1 point each) and listing your own collection (1 point per listing).

**Stakeholders**: Stake large amounts of $EMARK tokens for consistent point accumulation and increased voting power.

### Leaderboard Competition

- View real-time rankings on the leaderboard
- Points are tracked permanently with full transaction history
- Top performers gain community recognition and influence
- Historical data preserved for long-term achievement tracking

The points system creates a sustainable economy that rewards both content creation and marketplace participation, driving organic growth and community engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyber theme
- **State Management**: React Query + React Context
- **Storage**: ArDrive (Arweave) + IPFS (Pinata) + Supabase caching
- **Blockchain**: Thirdweb SDK + Wagmi + Viem (Base Network)
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions + Supabase
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Storage Architecture

```
User Upload ‚Üí ArDrive (Permanent) ‚Üí Blockchain (Metadata URI)
                ‚Üì            ‚Üì
           IPFS (Fast)   Supabase (Cache) ‚Üê Background Sync
```

**Unified Storage Approach**: Content stored on ArDrive (Arweave) for permanent preservation, IPFS for fast access, with Supabase providing optimized caching for the best user experience.

## üìö Development

### Project Structure

Each feature follows this pattern:
```
features/[feature-name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Feature-specific UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/         # State management hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/      # Pure business logic functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/         # TypeScript interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts       # Public API exports
```

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Define Types**: Create clear TypeScript interfaces
2. **Build Services**: Pure functions for business logic
3. **Create Hook**: Single state management hook
4. **Build Components**: UI components that use the hook
5. **Export API**: Clean public interface

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode with no `any` types
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for hooks
