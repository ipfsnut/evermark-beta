## Conclusion

This transaction provides strong evidence that:

1. **Fee documentation is accurate** - Real on-chain fees match documented amounts
2. **Smart contracts work as intended** - No discrepancies between code and behavior  
3. **Treasury system is functional** - Fees are properly collected and routed
4. **No hidden beneficiaries** - Fees go directly to documented development wallet
5. **System is production-ready** - Successful mint with proper anti-spam fee handling

The Evermark protocol's minting fee structure is operating exactly as documented, with transparent, predictable anti-spam fee collection that funds development costs while remaining completely separate from any staking reward distribution system.
