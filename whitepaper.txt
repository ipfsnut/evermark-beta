                    EVERMARK PROTOCOL WHITEPAPER
                  Decentralized Content Preservation
                     Built for Permanence
====================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

Evermark Protocol is a decentralized platform for creating permanent, verifiable 
references to digital content. Built on Base blockchain with IPFS storage, it 
enables users to preserve and curate valuable online content through a community-
driven governance system powered by economic incentives.

The protocol features a dual-token economy ($EMARK utility, wEMARK governance), 
stake-based content verification, seasonal voting cycles, and adaptive reward 
distribution that creates sustainable value flows between content creators, 
curators, and the broader community.

KEY INNOVATION: IPFS-first architecture with Supabase caching provides true 
decentralization while maintaining optimal user experience.

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
===================

CONTENT IMPERMANENCE CRISIS
---------------------------
The modern internet suffers from link rot, content deletion, and platform 
centralization. Valuable digital content - academic papers, social media posts, 
web articles, research data - disappears when platforms shut down, URLs break, 
or content is removed.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS
------------------
- URLs become inaccessible over time (link rot)
- Platform dependency creates single points of failure
- No verifiable attribution or ownership
- Community curation lacks economic incentives
- Content discovery relies on algorithmic manipulation

OPPORTUNITY
-----------
Blockchain technology and IPFS enable permanent, decentralized content 
preservation with economic incentives for quality curation and verification.

2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
=======================

CORE CONCEPT
-----------
Evermark Protocol creates "evermarks" - permanent, blockchain-verified references 
to digital content stored on IPFS with community-driven curation through 
economic staking and voting mechanisms.

KEY FEATURES
-----------
1. **Content Preservation**: Upload any content to IPFS with metadata
2. **NFT Representation**: Each evermark becomes a unique ERC-721 token
3. **Stake-Based Verification**: Content creators stake NFTs to prove ownership
4. **Community Curation**: Token holders vote on content quality/importance
5. **Economic Rewards**: Dual-token reward system for participants
6. **Farcaster Integration**: Native support for social discovery

TECHNICAL STACK
--------------
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Blockchain: Base (Ethereum L2) via Thirdweb SDK v5
- Storage: IPFS (Pinata) with Supabase caching
- Backend: Netlify Functions + Supabase PostgreSQL
- Social: Farcaster Frame SDK + Mini App integration

3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
==========================

FEATURE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------
The codebase follows a modular, feature-first organization:

```
src/features/[feature-name]/
├── components/     # Feature-specific UI components
├── hooks/         # State management (single main hook per feature)  
├── services/      # Business logic & API calls (pure functions)
├── types/         # TypeScript interfaces
├── abis/          # Smart contract ABIs
└── index.ts       # Public API exports
```

CORE FEATURES
------------
1. **Evermarks** (/src/features/evermarks/)
   - Content creation and preservation system
   - IPFS upload with metadata generation
   - Blockchain minting and ownership tracking

2. **Staking** (/src/features/staking/)
   - $EMARK token locking for voting power
   - 7-day unbonding period
   - Non-transferrable wEMARK receipt tokens

3. **Voting** (/src/features/voting/)
   - Seasonal content curation cycles
   - Direct voting without delegation
   - On-chain vote tracking

4. **Leaderboard** (/src/features/leaderboard/)
   - Community-driven content rankings
   - Historical season data
   - Vote-based scoring

5. **Tokens** (/src/features/tokens/)
   - $EMARK balance and transaction management
   - Dual-token reward claiming
   - Token approval workflows

PROVIDER HIERARCHY
-----------------
React Context providers wrap the app in specific order:
1. QueryClientProvider (React Query)
2. ThirdwebProvider (blockchain SDK)
3. FarcasterProvider (Frame/auth context)
4. WalletProvider (wallet connection)
5. BlockchainProvider (contract interactions)
6. IntegratedUserProvider (unified user management)
7. AppContextProvider (app-level state)

STATE MANAGEMENT PATTERN
-----------------------
- Global State: Auth, wallet, UI state via React Context
- Server State: API/blockchain data via React Query (30s stale time)
- Feature State: Each feature exports ONE main state hook
- Local State: Component-specific UI state via useState

STORAGE ARCHITECTURE
-------------------
```
User Upload → IPFS (Primary) → Blockchain (Metadata URI)
                ↓
            Supabase (Cache) ← Background Sync
```

IPFS-First Approach: All content uploads directly to IPFS for permanent 
decentralized storage, with Supabase providing fast caching for optimal 
user experience.

4. SMART CONTRACT SYSTEM

5. TOKEN ECONOMICS
=================

DUAL-TOKEN SYSTEM
----------------

**$EMARK Token (Utility)**

- Tradeable on Clanker with WETH liquidity

**wEMARK Token (Governance)** 
- Non-transferrable receipt token for staked EMARK
- 1:1 conversion ratio with 7-day unbonding period

ADAPTIVE POOL ECONOMICS
----------------------

**Pool-Based Distribution**
- Reward rates adjust based on actual pool balances
- No infinite emission - rewards come from funded pools
- Fixed rates for period duration (typically 7 days)
- Transparent pool balances and rates visible on-chain

**Rate Calculation Formula**
```
Annual Rate = (Pool Balance × Configured %) / Total wEMARK Supply
Period Rate = Annual Rate × (Period Duration / 365 days)
User Rewards = (User wEMARK / Total wEMARK) × Period Rate × Time Elapsed
```

VALUE FLOWS
----------

**Platform Revenue → Ecosystem**
1. Clanker EMARK/WETH trading generates 0.8% fees
2. FeeCollector receives 0.4% of trading fees
3. Admin forwards fees to EvermarkRewards pools
4. Rewards distributed to wEMARK stakers

**Token Utility Cycle**
1. Users acquire EMARK tokens
2. Stake to wEMARK for voting power and rewards
3. Vote in seasonal governance cycles
4. Earn WETH (value) + EMARK (utility) rewards
5. Compound by restaking earned EMARK

ECONOMIC INCENTIVES
------------------
- Staking Rewards: Direct financial incentive (WETH + EMARK)
- Voting Participation: Governance rights tied to economic stake
- Creator Verification: NFT staking proves content ownership
- Quality Curation: Community voting improves content discovery

6. GOVERNANCE & VOTING
=====================

SEASONAL VOTING SYSTEM
---------------------
- **Duration**: Admin-controlled seasonal periods (typically 7 days)
- **Participation**: Open to all wEMARK token holders
- **Voting Power**: Based on current wEMARK balance (1 token = 1 vote)
- **Scope**: Vote on any existing Evermark NFT

DIRECT VOTING MECHANICS
----------------------
- Vote directly for specific Evermarks (no delegation)
- Voting power limited to wEMARK balance per season
- Vote tracking prevents double-spending voting power
- Flexible distribution across multiple Evermarks

GOVERNANCE STRATEGY
------------------
- Quality Focus: Support content deserving recognition
- Power Management: Distribute votes strategically
- Community Curation: Surface best content through economic stakes
- Democratic Validation: Votes represent genuine community support

LEADERBOARD INTEGRATION
----------------------
- Seasonal rankings based on accumulated votes
- Historical data permanently stored on-chain
- Community recognition for quality content
- Creator credibility through voting history

7. CONTENT VERIFICATION
======================

STAKE-BASED VERIFICATION SYSTEM
------------------------------
Content creators can prove ownership through economic commitment:

**Verification Process**
1. Creator stakes their Evermark NFT (economic commitment)
2. 7-day challenge period for community review
3. Manual admin review of ownership claims
4. Verification badge for successful claims

**Economic Security**
- NFT staking creates opportunity cost
- Challenge requires 100 EMARK stake (anti-spam)
- Failed verification = forced unstake + permanent ban
- Successful challenges rewarded from verification pools

**Verification Benefits**
- Verified badge displayed across platform
- Enhanced credibility and discovery
- Access to verified-only sections
- Community trust and recognition

ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
------------------
- Economic stakes deter fraudulent claims

- Collected via FeeCollector contract
- Converted to WETH and EMARK for reward pools

**3. Future Revenue Opportunities**
- Premium features for verified creators
- API access for institutional users
